    "When executed, the program asks the user to enter a value. For example, in the demo below, the user is entering 10:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the program asks the user to enter what conversion they want to make (e.g., 3 means celsius to Kelvin)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the user’s choice, the program calls the function that does the required conversion (i.e., Celsius to Kelvin in our demo example).\n",
    "\n",
    "After the user has entered what conversion they want to make, the program calculates the converted temperature by executing the proper function and prints out the results:\n",

    "How This Project Matters in the Real-World\n",
    "\n",
    "This project introduces the concept of modular programming by organizing code into reusable functions. In real-world scenarios, temperature conversions are commonly used in weather applications, scientific calculations, and industrial systems. Such applications rely on functions to make the code scalable and maintainable. For example, in a weather tracking system, a temperature API might return data in Kelvin, and functions would be used to convert it into user-friendly formats like Celsius or Fahrenheit. Understanding how to break down tasks into smaller, reusable functions is essential for working on larger, real-world projects.\n",

While this is a simple implementation, similar concepts are used in advanced task management tools like Focusmate, Trello, or even mobile productivity apps.
